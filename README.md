## üåç Project Motivation
- India‚Äôs **building energy demand** is growing at **2.7% per year (2015‚Äì2040)**, over **2√ó the global average**.  
- IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN) has rapidly growing **academic, hostel, and research facilities**, leading to rising **electricity bills** and **cooling demands**.  
- To achieve **sustainability** and **cost efficiency**, it is crucial to analyze patterns, optimize room usage, and integrate renewable energy solutions.

---

## üéØ Objectives
1. Analyze monthly energy consumption trends at IITGN.
2. Study **cooling efficiency** across room sizes and occupancy.
3. Evaluate **solar energy integration** potential for hostels and academic blocks.
4. Forecast **future energy demands** using CAGR modeling.
5. Propose **sustainable policies** for reducing consumption and costs.

  - Seasonal and monthly variations in usage.  
  - Per-student consumption in different hostels.  

- **Simulation & Modeling**  
  - **EQUEST modeling** ‚Üí room size & occupancy energy efficiency.  
  - **Heat Transfer Models** ‚Üí effect of reflective paints, thermal resistance, and initial temperatures.  
  - **CAGR Forecasting** ‚Üí long-term power consumption predictions.  

- **Solar Energy Analysis**  
  - Evaluation of solar PV installations across 12 hostels.  
  - Capacity planning for a **250 kW grid**.  
  - ROI and payback period analysis.

## üîç Key Findings

### 1. Energy Consumption Patterns
- **80‚Äì90% of energy usage** is concentrated in:  
  - Hostels (23%)  
  - Academic buildings (36%)  
  - Chiller plants (31%)  
- Seasonal peaks in **May‚ÄìJuly** (AC demand) and **August‚ÄìSeptember** (post-vacation).  
- **August 2021 growth rate: +41.92%** ‚Äì highest observed.

---

### 2. Hostel Energy Usage & Occupancy
- Hostel **E** has the highest per-student consumption (~350 kWh/student).  
- Hostel **J** has the lowest (<50 kWh/student).  
- Converting **single ‚Üí double/triple rooms** reduces **per capita energy use** significantly:  
  - Single: ~2735 W/student  
  - Double: ~2190 W/student  
  - Triple: ~1816 W/student  

---

### 3. Chiller Plant Analysis
- Chiller Plants 01 & 02 show **summer spikes** in May‚ÄìJune.  
- Chiller Plant 03 remains relatively stable.  
- Chillers alone account for ~31% of IITGN‚Äôs total power consumption.

---

### 4. Room Size, Occupancy & Cooling Efficiency
- Larger rooms = **slower cooling rates** due to higher thermal inertia.  
- Reflective paint on walls reduces solar heat gain, improving cooling efficiency across all occupancy scenarios.  
- **Triple rooms** ‚Üí better space utilization and lower per-student cooling energy.

---

### 5. Solar Energy Analysis
- Current solar contribution: **~10‚Äì14% of monthly consumption**.  
- Hostels have **48,000‚Äì50,000 sq. ft rooftop area**, enough for a **250 kW solar grid**.  
- Estimated generation: **~290 kWh/day per hostel** (~3√ó current levels).  
- Financials:  
  - **Cost**: ‚Çπ1.17‚Äì1.25 Cr for 250 kW grid  
  - **Payback period**: 4‚Äì6 years  
  - **Lifetime**: 25 years  

---

### 6. Future Forecasting with CAGR
- CAGR model predicts **8‚Äì14% monthly growth** in power demand.  
- Without intervention, **power consumption will double in 6 years**.  
- Forecast (2026):  
  - **Total power demand > 4.7 million kWh/month**.  
  - **Academic areas & chillers** ‚Üí highest CAGR growth.  
  - Solar output shows stagnation ‚Äì highlighting the need for expansion.

## üèõ Policy Recommendations
1. **Solar Expansion**: Install additional panels on hostel rooftops & academic blocks.  
2. **Temperature Setpoints**:  
   - Hostels: 28¬∞C  
   - Academic Blocks: 25‚Äì26¬∞C  
3. **Programmable Thermostats**: Adaptive cooling based on occupancy & time of day.  
4. **Room Planning**: Promote **triple rooms** in new hostels.  
5. **Reflective Paint**: Apply on walls exposed to direct sunlight.  
6. **Behavioral Incentives**: Encourage students to choose shared rooms via reduced fees.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
- IITGN‚Äôs **energy consumption is rising sharply** due to hostels, academic activities, and chillers.  
- **Room size, occupancy, and paint** have measurable impacts on cooling efficiency.  
- **Solar energy adoption** is financially viable with **short payback** and long-term benefits.  
- Without interventions, **demand will double within 6 years**, straining infrastructure.  

Our project demonstrates that **through sustainable building design, occupancy planning, and renewable energy integration**, IITGN can achieve significant **energy savings**, reduce **carbon footprint**, and become a model for **green campuses** in India.
